**Challenge: Image classification using CNN for brain tumor analysis**

To summarize the overall tasks performed here, please find the details below.

Creating Dataset: We need to create the dataset for images and labels. We need to adjust the code based on how your data is structured and stored.
Model Complexity: We have used Conv2D layer for image analysis. For future extensions, we can look into different types of layers (like BatchNormalization), and possibly more advanced techniques like transfer learning.
ImageDataGenerator: Adjust the augmentation parameters based on our dataset to avoid overfitting and to improve model generalizability.
Model Fitting: Fit the model from the test dataset
Plot confusion matrix: Plot the confusion matrix for accuracy vs data loss.
This code provides a building block for using CNN for brain tumor detection. Experimentation with model architecture, hyperparameters, and data augmentation is essential for improving performance.

Future enhancements: Image classification via edge detection technique
